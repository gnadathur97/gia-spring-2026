Extensible languages are ones that can evolve to include new features
that meet their users' needs. An influential approach to designing
such languages is based on developing a library of extensions around a
"host" language; users can draw as needed from the library to obtain a
language that meets their programming needs. A key requirement of such
an approach is modularity: extensions should be designable
independently with the guarantee that they will function appropriately
when combined with other components. An important part of "functioning
appropriately" is that it should be possible to state and establish
formal properties of the resulting language. In past work, we have
developed and proved sound a modular approach to meeting this
requirement. A key ingredient of our approach is that the host
language has the capability to constrain the behavior of
extensions. This project will understand the practical consequences of
this structure. Additionally, it will examine the compatibility of the
approach with a new, powerful, and increasingly popular method for
describing program behavior. This work will help fill a gap in a
recent competitive but unsucessful National Science Foundation
proposal.
