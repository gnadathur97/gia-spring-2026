The PIs anticipate that each of the two research efforts described in
the Plan of Work section of the proposal will take around one semester
for the RA to complete. Having both of these pieces well developed for
a resubmission of the proposal will be important to addressing the
issue and having a highly competitive proposal. Thus we are requesting
2 semesters of funding for the RA. 

It may be possible to have a highly competitive proposal if only the
first effort, the more theoretical hypothesis validation step, is
completed, and only a significant start on the second more empirical
step is made. Thus we expect to reach the stated goals of this
proposal if the first step takes longer than anticipated, or if we
need to make use of slightly less than the total requested amount.
