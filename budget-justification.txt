The PIs anticipate that each of the two research components described
in the Plan of Work section of the proposal will take around one
semester for a graduate research assistant (GRA) to complete. Having
both of these pieces well addressed in a resubmission of the NSF
proposal will be provide a comprehensive response to the issues
raised. In our estimation, this will make it a highly competitive 
proposal. For this reason, we are requesting two semesters of support
for a GRA in this proposal.

======================
Use this para if it works
======================

Of the two research components, it is our estimation that having the
first issue completely addressed will be more critical to a
resubmission of the NSF proposal than the second; this is the part of
the project that demonstrates the compatibility of our scheme for
modular proof development with the new, logical approach to specifying
the semantics of programming languages. Thus, in a scenario where
funds are extremely limited, we can envisage the support for the
second semester being reduced in half to support a 25% GRA rather than
the currently requested 50%. However, this is not the ideal choice
from the perspective of addressing the questions raised relative to
our NSF proposal, which is why we have not structured our request in
this manner at the outset.

=====================
This is the old second para. Leaving it in place in case the
replacement does not work.
=====================

It may be possible to have a highly competitive proposal if only the
first effort, the more theoretical hypothesis validation step, is
completed, and only a significant start on the second more empirical
step is made. Thus we expect to reach the stated goals of this
proposal if the first step takes longer than anticipated, or if we
need to make use of slightly less than the total requested amount.
