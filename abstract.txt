Extensible languages are ones that can evolve with new features to
meet their user's needs, especially in specific problem domains. This
approach allows languages to be more expressive than conventional
ones. Extensibility, however, raises challenges to ensuring that
languages, and independent extensions to them, actually work as their
designers intended.

We have developed a modular means for formally verifying the
correctness of extensible languages and their extensions using the
conventional "syntactic" approach. A new "logical" approach adds
considerable power to specifying languages and proving correctness
properties over them. This approach has gained traction recently and
was highlighted as missing in our work in a recent competitive, but
unsuccessful, National Science Foundation proposal.

We have developed some initial ideas about how our work can be extended
to this new approach, but they need further development and
evaluation through sample applications to be included in a successful
re-submission of the NSF proposal.  This is a significant effort and
one that we, as PIs, cannot complete in a reasonable amount of time on
our own. Thus, we are requesting Grant-in-Aid funding to help fill in
this gap so that a re-submission might be successful.
