Dear Committee Members:


% Special Requests for Established Investigators' Pilot Projects
% - Why can't the pilot data be obtained without GIA funding? 
% - Where will the proposed research lead? What competitions would you
%   be able to apply for?


Please find enclosed our Grant-in-Aid proposal entitled 
\emph{A Modular
Approach to Verifying Properties of Extensible Programming
Languages}.
%
We are submitting this proposal in the category of 
\emph{Special Requests for Established Investigators' Pilot Projects}.

In this proposal, we are requesting funds for a graduate research
assistant to assist in conducting preliminary investigations related
to an framework we have previously developed for reasoning modularly
about properties of extensible programming languages. These
investigations will address two issues raised concerning a recent
grant proposal to the National Science Foundation that was judged to
be competitive but that was ultimately unsuccessful. One of these
issues concerns the compatibility of our approach with a new way of
specifying the semantics of programming languages that is increasingly
being adopted by the community. The second issue concerns the
practical consequences of the constraints that our approach allows the
designer of the core part of a language to place on extensions to the
language.

It is our assessment that both questions can be answered in a
convincing way but it will take about a semester worth of work on the
part of a graduate research assistant to address each. Further,
providing carefully substantiated responses to these questions should
result in a highly competitive resubmission. The project will
ultimately be a multi-year effort that will need to be funded by an
agency such as the NSF to produce satisfactory results. The request of
the GIA program is, in a sense, for seeding the effort so that the
funding request of the NSF can be successful.
