Grant-in-Aid Proposal Review Committee

Dear Committee Members:


% Special Requests for Established Investigators' Pilot Projects
% - Why can't the pilot data be obtained without GIA funding? 
% - Where will the proposed research lead? What competitions would you
%   be able to apply for?


Please find enclosed our Grant-in-Aid proposal entitled 
\emph{A Modular
Approach to Verifying Properties of Extensible Programming
Languages}.
%
We are submitting this proposal in the category of 
\emph{Special Requests for Established Investigators' Pilot Projects}.

We are applying to Grant-in-Aid funds in order to complete some
preliminary investigations called for in a competitive, but
ultimately unsuccessful, grant proposal to the National Science
Foundation (NSF).

The proposal requests funds for a graduate research assistant to
assist in applying our approach to verifying properties of extensible
languages to a relatively new and promising way to specify programming
language semantics and to structure proofs for these kinds of
properties.

Our previous work built on the conventional ``syntactic'' approach
that has been used successfully for several decades. This work
includes the development of the core ideas and several applications
of them to sample languages and extensions to them. There is a newer
``logical'' approach that adds considerable power to specifying
languages and proving properties over them. 
%
We have some initial ideas about how our work can be extended to this new
approach, but we need to further develop these ideas and the
evaluation of the through sample applications for a successful
re-submission of the NSF proposal.

This is not a small task and one that we, as PIs, cannot complete in a
reasonable amount of time on our own. Thus we are requesting
Grant-in-Aid funding to help fill in the gap so that our re-submission
might be successful.

The program to which we are applying is one without annual deadlines,
and thus we anticipate re-submission shortly after the work proposed
here is completed.
